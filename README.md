            Set up session handling (like JWT or cookies) to keep users logged in.
        Protect Routes:
            Ensure that pages like the dashboard are only accessible to authenticated users.

Late Morning: Payment Integration

    Stripe API Setup (2-3 hours)
        Create a Stripe Account: If you haven't already, create an account and get your API keys.
        Install Stripe SDK: Use the official Stripe package for Node.js.
        Create Payment Endpoints:
            Set up server-side endpoints for handling payments.
            Implement a simple checkout page using Stripe's API to handle payment details.
        Test Payment Flow: Use Stripe's test mode to verify that payments can be processed.

Early Afternoon: Delivery Integration

    La Poste API Integration (1-2 hours)
        Get API Credentials: If you haven't yet, sign up for the La Poste API.
        Implement Delivery Logic:
            Create a function to calculate shipping based on the user’s address and order details.
            Integrate with your checkout process to allow users to choose delivery options.

Afternoon: UI Components

        Design Cart Component:
            Create a simple cart component to display selected items, total price, and checkout button.
        State Management:

        Fix Bugs:
            Address any issues that arise during testing.

    Deployment (1 hour)

Tips for Efficiency:

    Use AI Tools: Leverage AI tools for coding, testing, and debugging as you work through the tasks.
    Prioritize: Focus on getting the core functionalities working first, then add any additional features if time permits.
    Stay Organized: Keep track of what you've completed and what’s left to do to stay on schedule.
